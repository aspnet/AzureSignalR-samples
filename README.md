# Welcome to Azure SignalR Service

This repository contains documentation and code samples for Azure SignalR Service.

Azure SignalR Service is an Azure managed service that helps developers easily build web applications with real-time features.

This service supports both [ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR) and [ASP.NET SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR). [SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR) is an open source library that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications. 

> The ASP.NET Core version is not a simple .NET Core port of the original SignalR, but a [rewrite](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2017/09/14/announcing-signalr-for-asp-net-core-2-0/) of the original version. As a result, [ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR) is not backward compatible with [ASP.NET SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) (API interfaces and behaviors are different). If it is the first time you try SignalR, we recommend you to use the [ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR), it is **simpler, more reliable, and easier to use**.
